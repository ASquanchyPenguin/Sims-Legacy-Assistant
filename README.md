# Sims Legacy Assistant (Beta)
*Last Updated 2 August, 2018*<br/>

## Description
The Sims Legacy Assistant is a command based program designed to help maintain legacy runs in EA's the Sims 4.

## Current Features
1. Creates random Sims with traits and aspirations.
2. Age up Sims on command to update their traits and aspirations if needed.
3. Supports additional (or custom) traits and aspirations from mods or DLCs.
4. Save and Load Legacies to and from a file.
5. Rolls random (and customizable) life events to randomize a sim's story.
6. Prevents Sims in the same household from traits and aspirations, if desired. 
*(This feature supports up to about 8 sims before traits will naturally overlap.)*

## Trait Modes
The program supports three modes for assigning traits. All modes avoid conflicts.
1. Random: Assigns traits randomly, with no restrictions.
2. Balanced Mood: Only allows one emotional trait to be assigned. There are no other restrictions.
3. Balanced Type: Only allows one trait per type.

## Future Updates
A few more house-keeping tools are planned before leaving Beta. A few examples include:
1. Stipulations for young adult sims and older. 
*(This is an optional feature to add restrictions on gameplay.)*
2. A command to adjust various settings in Sims Legacy Assistant.
3. The ability to change aspirations and traits as desired.
4. The option to include or exclude a Sim in the legacy after they've passed on. 
*(This prevents the Sim from being used in most commands and excludes their characteristics in Balanced Legacy Mode.)*

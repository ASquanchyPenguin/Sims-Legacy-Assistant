## Trait Modes

## Future Updates
A few more house-keeping tools are planned before leaving Beta. A few examples include:
1. Stipulations for young adult sims and older. 
*(This is an optional feature to add restrictions on gameplay.)*
2. The ability to change aspirations and traits as desired.
3. The option to include or exclude a Sim in the legacy after they've passed on. 
*(This prevents the Sim from being used in most commands and excludes their characteristics in Balanced Legacy Mode.)*
